Welcome to Name That Tool! In this game, you'll be shown images of tools, and for every tool you can name, you'll get points! There's no penalty for guessing wrong, so make sure to enter something before time runs out!

There are three rounds, and more points are available the later you get into the game. Likewise, the tools will become more obscure as the rounds advance, so even if you fall behind early, don't give up! Everybody loves a good comeback story!

Best of luck to all of our players!
